# Just Draw It
*"Dont't waste your time by describing it, just draw it!"*

This plugin makes it easier to make simple sketches whenever you are taking notes in Obsidian.
Easily draw on your embedded images. Just change the (!) of a embed link to a (?).
Or just create a new drawing using `?[[filename.png]]`.
## Features
- Mimic standard Obsidian behaviour that you are already used to. Just change the (!) to a (?) when pasting a new image in your note.
- Simple drawing tools with colorpicking options.
- Undo/Redo your actions.
- Drawings are directly saved in your vault as a png file. You can always change the (?) back to a (!) when your done with drawing.

## Usage
